A rare bird indeed, Nugget was busy getting his head chopped off in a stockyard when the Apocalypse hit. Left alive, but without feathers or a face of any kind, Nugget wandered into the wild outdoors, where he was shocked to find that all the other animals still had <i>their</i> heads. Nugget spent his first months of freedom in hiding, mortified at the thought of being seen.<br><br>

Eventually, Nugget was stumbled across by a curious tyke called Amnio, who thought up a quick solution to the little chicken's dilemma: a replacement head! Taking one of his dad's old baseball caps, Amnio drew a face on the front, then used it to cover Nugget's stump. With his confidence restored at last, Nugget now feels ready to step into the spotlight... so long as his head stays on.<br><br>
