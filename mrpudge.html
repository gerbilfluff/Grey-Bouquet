<P><B>After following Amnio home one day, this ex-poodle didn't last
long against the little guy's radiation. However, Pudge's loyalty was
already so strong for his master that he dug himself out of his
backyard grave the same night he was placed in it, so he could be by
Amnio's side forever.<BR><BR>Unfortunately, one side effect of
becoming a zombie dog is that Mister Pudge can't remember how to do
anything besides eat, sleep, and drool. Which he's content to do. <I>A
lot.</I> Especially the drooling part.<BR><BR>Still, every kid should
have a dog, and Mister Pudge at least technically fits the
bill.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE=4>Likes:</FONT> Amnio; food<BR><FONT SIZE=4>Dislikes:</FONT>
