<b><big>Amnio</big></b>
</p>
</center>

<p><b>
This little gas-masked fetus... thing... is the son of Warren and Lindsey Horsemann. (His full name is "Amniormageddon," but his parents figured that was too hard for a youngster like him to spell right away, so everyone just calls him Amnio.)<br><br>

Amnio may be young, but thanks to his parents' continued near-celebrity status, he's already well-known by those in the Afterworld. Whenever Dad is busy making a killing at his new job as a stockbroker or Mom's caught up in her cosmetics company CEO duties, Amnio can run and play outside as he pleases. Anyone he meets will be more than willing to help him on his way; like him or not, no one's going to mess with the kid of folks who used to wipe out entire civilizations between lunch breaks.<br><br>

Not that Amnio's let fame go to his head. In fact, he's barely aware of why his family is famous in the first place, or that the world was ever any different from how it is now. He never means to bring harm to anyone; he simply enjoys having fun in his surroundings, like any kid. To Amnio, the neighborhood playground has always been a smoldering toxic waste dump, air raid sirens are <i>supposed</i> to sing along with the birds every morning, and some kinds of "fun" have larger blast radiuses than others.<br><br>

<big>Likes:</big> his friends and family; his atomic bomb plushie; being his own glow-in-the-dark nightlight at bedtime; gigantic explosions<br>
<big>Dislikes:</big> the deadly radioactive waves his body gives off at all times (though it's fun to play "Bugzapper" when it's dark out)<br>
<big>Dreams and Goals:</big> to be famous, just like Mom and Dad; having his own pony someday
